# ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡³ Tunisian Dialect Hate Speech and Abuse Detection Using TunBERT
This repository provides a comprehensive pipeline for detecting hate speech, abusive language, and neutral content in the Tunisian dialect. The approach leverages the pre-trained BERT-based language model AhmedBou/TuniBert, specifically adapted for the nuances of Tunisian Arabic.

This work replicates the experimental methodology detailed in the peer-reviewed publication:

"Tunisian Dialect Hate Speech and Abuse Detection with BERT-Based Models"

##  Overview
Overview
The repository offers tools and scripts to preprocess dialectal Arabic text, fine-tune the TunBERT model on the publicly available T-HSAB dataset, and evaluate classification performance on hate speech and abusive language detection tasks.

## Key Features
Utilizes the publicly available T-HSAB dataset annotated for hate speech, abuse, and neutral content.

Implements preprocessing and normalization techniques tailored to dialectal Arabic.

Employs Hugging Faceâ€™s AutoTokenizer for tokenization aligned with the AraBERT, ARBERT, MARBERT, and TunBERT models.

Fine-tunes the transformer model using TensorFlow.

Provides evaluation metrics: F1-score, Precision, Recall, and Confusion Matrix.

Compatible with Google Colab and local execution environments.

## Dataset
Download the original T-HSAB dataset from the official repository:

ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/Hala-Mulki/T-HSAB-A-Tunisian-Hate-Speech-and-Abusive-Dataset

Place the dataset file (e.g., thsab.csv) inside the data/ directory. The file should contain two columns: texte and categorie.

## Installation and Usage
### Clone the repository


git clone https://github.com/tunisian-hate-speech-pipeline.git
cd tunisian-hate-speech-pipeline

### Install dependencies


pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run the pipeline

Launch the Jupyter notebook locally or in Google Colab:


jupyter notebook pipeline_thsab_tunibert.ipynb
Follow the notebookâ€™s instructions to preprocess data, fine-tune the model, and evaluate performance.

## Preprocessing
The preprocessing pipeline includes:

Arabic character normalization (e.g., Ø¥ â†’ Ø§, Ø© â†’ Ù‡)

Removal of punctuation and repeated letters

Tokenization using Hugging Faceâ€™s AutoTokenizer for TunBERT

## Evaluation Metrics
The model is evaluated using:

F1-Score (macro-averaged)

Precision and Recall per class

Confusion matrix visualization


## Model
We utilize TunBert, a transformer-based model pretrained on Tunisian dialect social media data, optimized for dialectal Arabic understanding.
